                 PROBLEM OF EXISTING SYSTEM
1. Inability of modification of data: The managing of huge data
 effectively and efficiently for efficient results, storing the details of the
 consumers etc. in such a way that the database can be modified as not
 possible in the current system
2. Not user friendly: The existing system is not user friendly because
the retrieval and storing of data is slow and data is not maintained
efficiently.
3. Difficulty in reports generating: Either no reports generating in a
current system or they are generated with great difficulty reports take
time to generate in the current system.
4. Manual operator control: Manual operator control is there and lead
to a lot of chaos and errors.
5. Lot of paperwork: Existing system requires lot of paper work and
even a small transaction require many papers fill. Moreover any
unnatural cause (such as fire in the organization) can destroy all data of
the organization. Loss of even a single paper led to difficult situation
because all the papers are interrelated.
6. Inability of sharing the data: Data cannot be shared in the existing
system. This means that no two persons can use the same data in
existing system. Also the two departments in an organization cannot
interact with each other without the actual movement of data.
7. No support in decision-making: Existing system does not support
managerial decision-making.
8. No support in strategic competitive advantage: Existing system do
not support strategic competitive advantages.


             CHARACTERSTIC OF THE PROPOSED SYSTEM
1. Easiness in modification of data: The proposed system provides
managing of huge data effectively and efficiently for efficient results,
storing the details of the customers, employees etc. in such a way that
the database can be modified.
2. User friendly: The proposed system is user friendly because the
retrieval and storing of data is fast and data is maintained efficiently.
Moreover the graphical user interface is provided in the proposed
system,
 which provides user to deal with the system very easily.
3. Reports are easily generated: Reports can be easily generated in a
proposed system. So any type of reports can be generated in a proposed
system, which helps the managers in a decisions-making activity.
4. Sharing the data is possible: Data can be shared in proposed system.
This means that two or more persons can use the same data in existing
system provided that they have right to access that data. Also the two
or more departments in an organization can easily interact with each
other without the actual movement of data.
5. No or very few paperwork: The proposed system either does not
require paper work or very few paper works is required. All the data is
feted into the computer immediately and various bills and reports can be
generated through computers. Since all the data is kept in a database no
data of the organization can be destroyed. Moreover work becomes very
easy because there is no need to keep data on papers.
6. Support strategic competitive advantage: Proposed system supports
strategic competitive advantages. Since the proposed systems provide
easiness in reports generating it will provide strategic advantages among
competitors.
7. Computer operator control: Computer operator control will be there
no errors. Moreover storing and retrieving of information is easy. So
work can be done speedily and in time.
